lead actress film melanie griffith looking buxom beautiful ever realize somethings wrong life whatever terribly stale scene woody allen film great opening shots without heart sank soon got used fact new film going great past works though record last years deconstructing harry came awfully close hell happened man relied neurotic freshness cinema become less funny films become less insightful like tossed together unfinished ideas bullets broadway though wonderful relies irony pull farce just never totally takes mighty aphrodite full great moments lines really great story everyone says love great idea great film even deconstructing harry admittingly cheap way even top one truly hilarious films anything reception celebrity everyone tip allen fact time audience critics wrong wonderful film celebrity yes good film marginally satisfying woody allen film instead creating great woody allen world hes created world subject knows bit hes fashioned film based almost entirely uninformed philosophy celebrities plays like series skits minor connections like la dolce vita without accuracy right amount wit correct personal crisis woody becoming insecure old age choses drop woody allen character world celebrities hang flaws scrutiny casting brit actor kenneth branagh lead much said performance dead irritating makes one yearn real thing blah blah blah anyone actually knows woody allen character knows branaghs performance though featuring mannerisms stuttering whining lots hand gestures hardly wartsandall impersonation branagh brings along little woody allen charm actually

give us brief history dune universe piece storytelling mca tvs version dune clearly superior piece editing however times surprisingly inept use painted stills new prologue works well enough occasional appearance action begins inappropriate theres sloppy cutting instances shots even appear order use repeated footage fabricate certain scenes eg ships coming going soldiers coming going times clearly

lynch wasnt even herberts book scene features baron harkonnen killing beautiful young man front slobbering henchmen pulling heart plug surreal disturbing episode thats lynchesque adds nothing already know baron nasty piece work despite peculiar flaws extended version dune generally superior film contains minutes restored footage approximately another minutes either altered fabricated newly created
