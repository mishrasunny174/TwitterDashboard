kong films days availability united states limited films must either purchased via pirates sought asian distributors tai seng subtitling copy slightly hard read letters white bit small although american release will almost certainly dubbed review subtitled version please keep mind youre reading review help decide whether go see fair must admit ive never fond periodpiece martial arts moviesthe ones set nebulous china distant distant past perhaps ive seen filmed inferior stock either butchered dubbing allbutillegible subtitling perhaps plots tend similar many cases nonexistant fact many get wrapped subplots seem forget main plot entirely minutes end matter might jackie chan films modern settings armour god rumble bronx etc tend spectacular stunts often involving large motor vehicles large explosions whereas period pieces simply martial arts said must now turn right around say drunken master ii remarkable exception one better martial arts films ive seen quite enjoyed surprised well drunken master ii young man named wong feihong played jackie chan master drunken boxing style kung fu learned style uncertain father wong keiying ti lung steadfast opposition feihongs practicing rather normal style kung fu apparently feihong sort figure chinese folklore rather like paul bunyan americans ive heard little quite well wrong ill leave analysis people know better one friends points character wong feihong also featured upon time china movies yet seen plot drunken master ii somewhat hazy plots many films youre watching jackie chan film odds arent expecting something order war peace story seems revolve around evil foreigners spiriting away ancient chinese relics hence chinas cultural heritage overworking underpaying beating chinese workers nearby steel mill however plot merely serves framework main story filmfeihongs perpetual struggle win girlfriend supplicate father keep pregnant mother played anita mui fighting keep getting beaten evil foreigner thugs macguffin drives plot precious antique jade imperial seal taken away evil foreigners beginning feihong accidentally steals trying recover identicallywrapped box containing medicinal ginseng father bringing back customer process clashes another thief trying seal ends instead ginseng feihong narrowly avoids getting caught seal evil foreigners lackies thanks timely intervention generals son cameo appearance andy lau later take starring role drunken master iii comedic chaos ensues back wong household feihong mother attempt come replacement missing ginseng goes plot thickens later feihongs girlfriend maneuvers kung fu match rival feihong thief now revealed loyalist manchu officer trying recover seal stop evil foreigners attacked en masse another grand kungfu movie tradition think ive already spent time plot really deserves lets move real draw jackie chan movies action theres plenty martial arts action found movie course kung fu film thats expected however isnt just another kung fu movie one jackie chan fight stunt choreography jackie chan genius primary martial arts style featured film drunken boxing form kung fu attempts draw adversary guard making seem like fellow using drunk purposes film least drunken boxers fight better actually intoxicated theres fine line just drunk enough drunk stupor normal circumstances idea someone staggering around looking sloshed managing fight effectively even incredibly might seem rather stupid jackie pulls flair kung fu sequences intricate staging execution pointless try describe paper ill just say fightsespecially big climactic fight endin make movie worth watching another thing drunken master ii going stunt work even without motor vehicles well counting train remarkable stunts film among things jackie dives balcony table crawls across hot coals least twice count outtake shown credits quicktime movies stunts can found www movie database unlike american films stunts faked drunken master ii stars several veteran actors hong kong movie scene including jackie ti lung better tomorrow anita mui heroic trio series rumble bronx performances firstrate especially comes comedy parts film scene feihong mother conspire literally behind feihongs fathers back cover missing ginseng root hilarious scene feihongs mother just revealed pregnant threatening hurt order draw husbands anger away feihong jackie developed knack physical comedy sort mastery years hes fine form drunken master ii far cinematography concerned certainly works film nothing spectacular least dozen times better old kung fu movies picture crisp clear one thing find particularly worthy mention least copy screen wider film ive ever seen videotape beforealmost whole screen blocked watch bigscreen tv movie theater can will utter shame film eventually panandscanned american video release drunken master ii shows full potential period piece kung fu movies good enough overcome even usual distaste movies plot meander bit thats expected type film like
